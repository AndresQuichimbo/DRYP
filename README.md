# DRYP: Parsimonious Dryland Water Partition model
DRYP is a simple process-based spatial distributed model developed to quantify the water partitioning and flowpaths in dryland regions. The key characteristic of DRYP is the hability to represent the development of ephemeral streams, typical in arid and semi-arid regions.
The model has three main components:
- Surface compoonent, to represent runoff, infiltration and transmission losses
- Unsaturated zone, to represent the vadose zone, evapotranspiration, and recharge
- Saturated component, that reprsent the groundwater flow
